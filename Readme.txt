This code was created in Summer of 2013. It creates the basis of a synchronous rogue-like game running on ubuntu terminal windows. It runs at one frame per user input and requires NCURSES to run. The project is now abandoned, but includes a modified line-of-sight algorithm, game states, menus, and simple combat; feel free to rip it apart and improve/learn.

To build:
 run the make.sh file
 ./testbuild
